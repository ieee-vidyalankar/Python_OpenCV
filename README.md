## Download Python3:
All my projects in Python 3, which will be replaced by it successor but most probably there shall not be much issue other than chages of syntax the same which we face with python 2.X and 3.X

## To download Python3 
Click the link [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-371/)


## Install opencv 
### For windows installation of anaconda is necessary for working with opencv3
[click here](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/) to download Anaconda3

1. Installation via command line:
```
conda install -c menpo opencv(for windows)

python -m pip install opencv-python(for Mac)
```
2. For users with OS other than the Windows and MAC OS [click here](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/table_of_content_introduction/table_of_content_introduction.html#table-of-content-introduction) for installation details

## Downloading Haarcascade classifiers :
For projects involving face and eye detection we need the .XML files which are already provided in this repsitory to stay updated fork the opencv github repository 
[click here](https://github.com/Preetam2114/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades) for the link 

## Other requirements
We do require libraries like Matplotlib which do come pre-installed with anaconda but just in case you missed run the following command 
```
pip install matplotlib
```
###### Note:: This repository does contain certain basic scripts for getting started with programming in python 

## Getting started with Opencv
The Opencv Py :file_folder: does contain various basic scripts and small projects demonstaring the use of opencv in python 
for the demonstartion we have used opencv3 so start experimenting with these scripts Happy learning

###### Note: make sure the image files are in the same directory as opencv won't throwup error for it instead it will give a blacked screen output
